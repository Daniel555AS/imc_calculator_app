# Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator App

---

## Introduction

The development of this application is part of my learning process in Flutter and Dart, tools for cross-platform mobile application development. As a formative project, a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator app has been designed and built, aimed at allowing users to quickly estimate their nutritional status based on basic data such as weight and height.

This project has been a valuable opportunity to apply various essential concepts of mobile development, including the design of attractive user interfaces, the structuring of reusable components, handling user input, performing calculations, and clearly presenting results.
